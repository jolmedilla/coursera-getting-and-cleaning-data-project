### How to run the script

  1.Copy `run_analysis.R` to the directory where you have the Samsung data, bear in
mind that there should be two folders in it, `test` and `data`, containing each
of the data sets with same names.
  2.Now simply read the R file from your R interpreter started from that same 
directory, this way:
  ```R
  > source('./run_analysis.R')
  ```
  The result will be generated in a file called `result.txt`
